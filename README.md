# Image Segmenter ([SegFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15203))

This code enables the creation of a model that segments objects in a images based on a specified data structure.

## 🛠️ Config

To execute the code set the following variables in the `fit.yaml` file.

- `trainer:logge:save_dir`: Output path for saving model weights.
- `model:num_classes`: Total number of classes.
- `model:learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.
- `data:path`: Path to the data, following the structure outlined in the Data Structure section.
- `data:input_size`: Shape used for the input image, e.g., 256 for 256x256.
- `data:batch_size`: Batch size used during the training process.
- `data:workers`: Number of CPU cores allocated for the data loader.

## 🗂️ Data structure

The data structure consists of two main directories: train and validation. Each of these directories contains two subdirectories named images and masks. The images directory contains multichannel images or RGB images, while the masks directory contains the corresponding image labels in 8-bit image format. Both the images and masks directories contain NumPy files (.npy), named with consecutive numbers, e.g., 0.npy, 1.npy, n.npy. The relationship between images and masks is one-to-one, meaning that for each image file, there is a corresponding mask file with the same consecutive number, e.g., {images/0.npy, masks/0.npy}.

## ⚙️ Usage

To execute training process run the following in console/terminal:

```
python main.py fit --config fit.yaml
```
